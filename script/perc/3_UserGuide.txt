STATEMENT OF USE

This checker catches violations of DRC-uncheckable rules of layout guidelines for IO latch-up and ESD. 
These violations are not for sign-off purpose but to highlight possible ESD and latch-up design failures.
 
For current density related rules, the tool behaviour is static simulation and is to highlight potential 
risks but not slow/accurate SPICE simulation. 
 
The tool (Calibre-PERC) is based on LVS extraction; the target layout should be LVS clean 
and every IO, power, and ground pads should be correctly recognized as top ports.


USER GUIDE

1. USAGE OF ESD Checker:

    [ RECOMMENDATION FOR TEXT LABEL PREPARATION ]
    
        This checker is good for full chip or IO ring ESD/LUP check. To verify ESD and
        Latch-Up problem in your design by this checker, it is critical to correctly recognize
        Signal IO and Power/Ground Ports (Pads) to get accurate result. Top level text
        labels to be placed on GDS need to be carefully prepared, so the checker can locate
        right IO pads and Power/Ground Pads. We strongly recommend user to prepare top level 
        text labels in a file containing statements of "LAYOUT TEXT pin_name coordinate text_layer".
        This file will be included in top rule file. (Please refer to tsmc_lib/pad_info.rules)
    
    [ PERC INSTALLATION ]
        
        1) download LVS deck from TSMC on-line
        2) edit user configuration file: user.config
        3) execute: %> perl install.pl user.config

    [ PERC EXECUTION ]
        
        1) copy top file "perc_n03_<metal_scheme>.top" from installation path to work directory.
        2) edit top file accordingly. (Please refer to TSMC_DOC_WM/PERC_Userguide_N03.pdf for details)
        3) run perc:
            For Pure Topology (only TOPO switch is on):
                %> calibre -perc -hier -turbo -hyper perc_n03_<metal_scheme>.top

            For LDL/CD/P2P (any of LDL/CD/P2P switch is on):
                %> calibre -perc -ldl -hier -turbo -hyper -ys_hyper perc_n03_<metal_scheme>.top

    [ HOW TO EDIT PAD voltage ]
    
        Please refer to tsmc_lib/pad_info.rules
        
    [ HOW TO VIEW PERC RESULT ]

        For CDL check:    %> calibre -rve -perc svdb
        For Layout check: %> calibredrv -m <Layout> -rve -perc dfmdb

        Note : For P2P, default result database "perc.rep.p2p.rdb" is only for debug purpose.
               Please refer to "LDL: TSMC.ESD.P2P.rdb" tab in RVE for final result.
               If there is no violation, "TSMC.ESD.P2P.rdb" will not be reported.
    
    [ Note ]
        
        1) In this package, it checks current density distribution on Metals and Vias from I/O pad 
           to ESD devices instead of using DRC-like constraints that are described in DRM. 
           The tool behavior is static simulation; static current is fed from each I/O pad and 2nd 
           ESD discharge path as current source. For diodes or mos that connect I/O pad and P/G pad,
           they are identified as ESD devices and they were viewed as sink. Sinks for the same current
           source are shorted together for the later simulation.

        2) In DRM, the current density constraint is defined in Reliability chapter. Although the
           current density constraint for different shapes of vias or metals that lying on different
           shapes of the other metals will have different constraint values, due to tool limitation,
           only one constaint value could be defined for each layer. Take M1 for example,

                   VARIABLE IMAX_M1 22.8

                   PERC LDL CD M1 CONSTRAINT VALUE IMAX_M1

           As you can see, all M1's current density is defined as 22.8 mA per micron.
           In this release, middle-end is not included for current density check.

        3) Based on (1) and (2), current density check is more like a reference results due to its
           static simulation behavior, constant fed-in current, and the simplified current 
           density constraint values.
