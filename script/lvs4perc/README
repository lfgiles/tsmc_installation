Release Notes :
===============
1. For CCI flow, please follow the StarRC version that specified in latest StarRCXT techfiles.
   If you are not sure of the version of StarRC, please contact with RC team CAE.

2. CCI LVS deck has some important default changes,
   a. Remove CCI_DECK and DFM_RULE switches and add CCI_DFM_RULE swites.
   b. Calibre deck turns on "LVS_DECK" and turns off "CCI_DFM_RULE" by default.
   c. Turn on "CCI_DFM_RULE" and turn off "LVS_DECK" to do Star RC extraction
   d. Soft check can only be executed when "CCI_DFM_RULE" switch is turned off and "LVS_DECK" is turned on.
   e. All the merge functions are turned off by default.

3. By default, VIRTUAL CONNECT COLON is set yes. Please set to "NO" as doing full-chip checking.

4. Move "AP", "AP_pin", "RV" layers to remove_layers in starrcxt_mapping file for RC techfile without RDL.

5. Any OD/PO devices under TCDMMY or ICOVL will not be recognized.

6. Recommend to use "m" instead of "nf" in schematic. 
   Please check the "FinFET_NF_MOS_Parallel_Reduction.pdf" for details.

7. Because of several RC new features supported, this LVS deck isn't compatible with previous version of RC tchfiles. Please check with TSMC RC teams to get the correct RC techfile version.

8. For correct LVS installation, choosing a metal scheme is a MUST.
